    <p>These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite â€” he considers it a special occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish combine to make a deliciously addictive experience. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad and some French bread. Experiment with different cheeses for variety.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
        <li>Onion: Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Butter and flour: The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Milk: Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Assemble the casserole: Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the casserole: Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
    </ul>
